## Ain't Much But Honest Work

`Concepts` is with respect to my approach. `Difficulty` is normalized with `Language` with my best effort.

| Day | Language (\*: First time) | Concepts               | Difficulty | Thoughts                                                                                                                                             |
| :-: | :------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Python                    | String/List Operations | Very Easy  | Feels dangerous to join and split like that                                                                                                          |
|  2  | Rust                      | Components Design (?)  | Very Easy  | Rust is the comfort zone ðŸ¦€                                                                                                                          |
|  3  | C++                       | Sets                   | Easy       | Stateful solvers are not the cleanest but they get the job done                                                                                      |
|  4  | \*Go                      | Ranges                 | Easy       | Feels weird to have to create a directory and an extra file for each module, but the experience was smooth overall                                   |
|  5  | \*Kotlin                  | Stacks                 | Easy       | Kotlin is nice and clean, but [it](https://github.com/LittleGents/advent-of-code-2022-pun/blob/main/day5/main.kt#L132) just doesn't make sense to me |
|  6  | JavaScript (NodeJS)       | Circular Buffer        | Very Easy  | Still not really a JS fan, also couldn't get an LSP to work in Neovim :(                                                                             |
|  7  | Java                      | Recursion, Tree        | Hard       | You have to use a tree for this one, right? Right?                                                                                                   |
|  8  | C#                        | 2D Array               | Medium     | I honestly hate that you can't declare immutable variables in C#                                                                                     |
|  9  | Nim                       | Simple Linear Algebra  | Easy       | Nim's syntax is a bit cryptic, and its documentation could be a little better organized tbh...                                                       |
| 10  | Zig                       | Clock Cycle Simulation | Very Easy  | People who enjoy low-level programming would like Zig. Its community support and documentations are a bit lacking though                             |
