## Hello, Christmas!

`Concepts` is with respect to my approach. `Difficulty` is normalized with `Language` with my best effort.

| Day | Language (\*: First time) | Concepts                                        | Difficulty     | Thoughts                                                                                                                                                     |

|  1  | Python                    | String/List Operations                          | Very Easy      | Python gets the job done                                                                                                                                     |
|  2  | Rust                      | Deterministic Interactions                      | Very Easy      | Rust is the comfort zone ðŸ¦€                                                                                                                                  |
|  3  | C++                       | Set                                             | Easy           | Stateful solvers are not the cleanest but they work!                                                                                                         |
|  4  | \*Go                      | Ranges                                          | Easy           | Feels weird to have to create a directory and an extra file for each module, but the experience was smooth overall                                           |
|  5  | \*Kotlin                  | Stack                                           | Easy           | Kotlin is nice and clean, but [it](https://github.com/LittleGents/advent-of-code-2022-pun/blob/main/days1-9/day5/main.kt#L132) just doesn't make sense to me |
|  6  | JavaScript                | Circular Buffer                                 | Very Easy      | Still not really a JS fan, also couldn't get an LSP to work in Neovim :(                                                                                     |
|  7  | Java                      | Recursion, Tree                                 | Hard           | You have to use a tree for this one, right? Right?                                                                                                           |
|  8  | C#                        | 2D Array                                        | Medium         | I honestly hate that you can't declare immutable variables in C#                                                                                             |
|  9  | \*Nim                     | Simple Linear Algebra                           | Easy           | Nim's syntax is a bit cryptic, and its documentation could be a little better organized tbh...                                                               |
| 10  | \*Zig                     | Clock Cycle Simulation                          | Very Easy      | People who enjoy low-level programming would like Zig. Its community support and documentations are a bit lacking though                                     |
| 11  | \*Ruby                    | Modular Arithmetic                              | Easy/Medium    | Shouldn't have slept through discrete math in uni... Ruby is really clean; Definitely will explore more!                                                     |
| 12  | C                         | Graph, BFS                                      | Easy           | Implementing those structs and behaviors from scratch is really fun                                                                                          |

| 14  | \*Prolog                  | Recursive Simulation                            | Easy           | Couldn't figure out how to store a persistent integer in Prolog, so ended up hardcoding it in ;(                                                             |
| 15  | \*Groovy                  | Discrete Geometry                               | Hard           | First time we have to actually think about how to optimize the solution. Nice puzzle indeed!                                                                 |
| 16  | R                         | DFS, Search Optimization                        | Very Hard      | The solution is not immediately obvious. The search takes a while to run because I can't implement my optimization ideas properly in R :(                    |
| 17  | TypeScript                | Tetris, Linear Regression, (Modular Arithmetic) | Hard/Very Hard | Very interesting puzzle! I love the part where you reimplement Tetris :)                                                                                     |
